                        MML: LIST
                        =========

A utility program to list any text file to the LST: device using
the CP/M Plus time and date.


The file is listed with the following features
1.      Heading on each page with date time and file name
	The filename is preceeded by the user numer if not zero,
	and the disk device name.
2.      An incrementing page number.
3.	If time stamping implemented, the file TOD stamp is
	displayed as part of the heading.
4.      An optional line number before each line
	This line number will be the same as the line number
        used by the CP/M editor ED.
5.      Lines are skipped at the bottom of each page
	providing room for punch holes.
6.      Lines which would extend over the maximum number of
	characters, are continued on the next line. The line number
	is not incremented for a continuation.
7.      The checksum is optionally printed at the end of the listing

A number of the printing parameters including the page size may be
altered using the utility SETLIST.

DATE/TIME
---------

with CP/M 2.2.

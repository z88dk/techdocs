                   BUG REPORT - December 1983
                 ACCESSING SYSTEM TIME AND DATE
                 ------------------------------

BDOS 105 - Get Date and Time

This  BDOS function should copy the system internal date and time 
into  the  4-byte DAT structure passed as a pointer  in  register 
pair DE.

Under the BETA release of the implementation of CP/M Plus on  the 
Epson QX-10, this BDOS function fails to pass the date and time.

Instead the BETA release copies the date and time into any 4 byte 
area  at random over the whole 64k TPA area.  The result of  this 
could be catastrophic.

  *************************************************************
  *** Users should avoid the use of this BDOS function 105. ***
  *************************************************************

Alternative  method of accessing the date and time is to use  the 
method  employed  by  the DATE facility,  that is to  access  the 
System Control Block directly. This can be accomplished using the 
BDOS  function 49.  But prior to the call to the  System  Control 
Block,  the user must first make a call to the BIOS Time function 
26 (using the BDOS function 50).

The DATE facility fails to repeatedly call the BIOS Time function 
26  and consequently the command 'DATE C' does  not  continuously 
update the displayed clock.

BUG FIX
-------
The  error in the BETA BIOS which causes the failure of the  BDOS 
function  105 has been corrected and tested and will be  included 
in  the  next release of the customised BIOS for the  QX-10.  The 
current BETA release, unfortunately, cannot be upgraded.

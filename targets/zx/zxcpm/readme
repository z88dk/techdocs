CP/M software converted to the ZX Spectrum 128 + Betadisk interface (a.k.a. Pentagon 128)

The CP/M 2.2 implementation is by Kamil Karimov (https://zx-pk.ru/threads/155-zxcpm.html),
it was originally written for the Quorum Spectrum clone and adapted to a the standard ZX
memory model (TPA at $6001) in 2005.


How to build ASM.CM6:
cpmemu\cpm asm as0com.asm
cpmemu\cpm asm as1io.asm
cpmemu\cpm asm as2scan.asm
cpmemu\cpm asm as3sym.asm
cpmemu\cpm asm as4sear.asm
cpmemu\cpm asm as5oper.asm
cpmemu\cpm asm as6main.asm
cpmemu\cpm mload asm.cm6=as0com,as1io,as2scan,as3sym,as4sear,as5oper,as6main

mload.cm6 is on a single source file

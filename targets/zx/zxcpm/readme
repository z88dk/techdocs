CP/M software converted to the ZX Spectrum 128 + Betadisk interface (a.k.a. Pentagon 128)

The CP/M 2.2 implementation is by Kamil Karimov (https://zx-pk.ru/threads/155-zxcpm.html),
it was originally written for the Quorum Spectrum clone and adapted to a the standard ZX
memory model (TPA at $6001) in 2005.

The CP/M boot disk MUST NOT be used as a normal ZX Spectrum disk, just type RUN to boot.
The CATalog you see on the Spectrum side is not significant anymore, to edit the disk content
you need to ues CPMTOOLS, here's a valid diskdefs configuration:

# ZX Quorum 128
# ZX Profi (KLUG CP/M)
# ZX HOBBIT
diskdef quorum
  seclen 1024
  cylinders 80
  sectrk 5
  heads 2
  blocksize 2048
  maxdir 128
  boottrk 4
  os 2.2
end


You can also create a brand new non-bootable disk image with z88dk-appmake +cpmdisk,
specifying the "quorum" disk type, the right disk container for TRD images is 'raw'.



How to build ASM.CM6:
cpmemu\cpm asm as0com.asm
cpmemu\cpm asm as1io.asm
cpmemu\cpm asm as2scan.asm
cpmemu\cpm asm as3sym.asm
cpmemu\cpm asm as4sear.asm
cpmemu\cpm asm as5oper.asm
cpmemu\cpm asm as6main.asm
cpmemu\cpm mload asm.cm6=as0com,as1io,as2scan,as3sym,as4sear,as5oper,as6main

mload.cm6 is on a single source file

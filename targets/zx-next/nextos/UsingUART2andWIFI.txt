The ZX Next - The UART and Beyond.
----------------------------------

Verson 2.2c

The background to this feature of the ZX Next can be found on the system website:

https://www.specnext.com/the-next-on-the-network/ - with a video!

WARNING: This document will change in the next release
------------------------------------------------------

See also the Alpha IRQ driven UART driver system in the PLUSPACKCHANGELOG.TXT
this document will be updated at Version 3 to use that system.  The version of
TERMINAL provided is much better than .UART and you will have better results
following through some of the examples below but, note that some key controls
have changed like EDIT now changes the edit mode and GRAPHICS the BAUD rate -
as it uses the standard ROM keyboard driver the full PS2 is now supported and
of course any replacement IRQ keyboard driver will work.

What is the .UART command in BIN?
---------------------------------

The .UART command in the distribution is a development of the one from Victor's video
that provides more facilities to use the serial connection port either directly through
some form of serial converter e.g. a USB to TTL serial or standard RS232 module (probably
based on the MAX232) and of course to an ESP-01 WiFi module plugged in to the header.
This will work from NextOS and from ESXDOS at the moment.

The current controls are mapped to Spectrum keys:

EDIT		SHIFT+1 - Change BAUD RATE in a cycle.
CAPS LOCK	SHIFT+2 - On/off toggle (on by default)
TRUE VIDEO	SHIFT+3 - Debug mode for CIPSEND on/off (silent)
INV VIDEO	SHIFT+4 - CIPSEND mode on/off also does an ATE0
GRAPHICS	SHIFT+9 - ANSI on/off (not yet implemented)
DELETE		SHIFT+0 - (PS2 KB one does not work only first time for one backspace)
Exit Program	Symbol Shift and Space together.
  
It handles the UART protocol as per the website above:  

The ports are 0x143b = 5179 for RX and 0x133b = 4923 for TX.
A read on the TX port shows the status of the FIFO buffer and the TX line
bit 0: returns ‘0’ if the FIFO buffer is empty or ‘1’ if there is data to be collected.
bit 1: returns the TX status: ‘1’ when the TX is still transmitting the last byte or
       ‘0’ when the TX is idle.
bit 2: returns the FIFO buffer status: ‘1’ if the buffer is full, or 
       ‘0’ when the buffer has space to hold another incoming byte.

This is fine to use the serial interface as an ASCII terminal or the AT commands of
the ESP in single connection mode.  To do proper networking with the ESP you will need
a full suite of interrupt driven drivers - which I'm sure are being brewed in a lab at the
moment.

Using the UART without a WiFi module
------------------------------------

A USB serial connection allows you to do all sorts of clever things - it is possible
to connect up to a PC like this for transferring data.  In fact if you were an early
purchaser you probably bought one with your ESP-01 as it is the one needed to program it. 

If you use one of the easy to get TTL modules then you can communicate with PC's and
other older machines - E.g. a real Spectrum with Interface 1... KevB is using one
for his PC on the forum at https://www.specnext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=895  

It should be possible just to hook up to an external Raspberry PI for example and use
a serial console connection allowing you to use the ZX Next as the keyboard...
as the voltages match it should be fine just to connect the UART RX/TX and GND
to the PI's PIN's 4/5/6 GND/TXD0-GPIO14/RXD0-GPIO15
See https://elinux.org/RPi_Serial_Connection there is a diagram of the GPIO header
on https://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals just be aware of the differences with a PI3.

I just want to use my WiFi module
---------------------------------

So if you are not an adventurous hardware hacker and have plugged in an ESP01 WiFi module
or have a machine with one prefitted then lets look at using that...

Having watched the Video to save you pausing all the time here is how to make it do
something with a few early steps.

First of all when you press ENTER you should get 'ERROR' because you didn't send a valid
command to the ESP module...

If you don't then it may be a number of things:

You are using the TBU and firmware BEFORE 0.8 and NextOS 1.92 - if so this will only work
at 3.5Mhz so slow the machine down and restart .UART!

You are using a TBU and firmware with a Core .29 or greater, with an OLD copy
of the UART program which wrote the BAUD rate differently - if so when you cycle through
the speeds EDIT (SHOFT+1) you will find it may 'work' at 38400 - it is actually a fluke as the
old value for that rate is quite close to the value needed for 115200 on the new system.

Your module may have come with a default baud rate other than the 115200 of the Next.
Using EDIT (SHIFT+1) you can cycle through each option pressing enter until you see ERROR!
(If you can see the module then many have a little blue light that flashes when receiving)

Once you have that you should be able to type 'AT' and press ENTER.

That should give OK...

Probably the first thing you want to do is tell the module to use the default speed of the
next so type:

AT+UART=115200,9,1,0,0 and press ENTER

You now need to used EDIT (SHIFT and 1) to go back around to 115200 so that
[ENTER] gives ERROR and AT[ENTER] gives OK again....

We just used one of the AT commands 

AT+UART=<baudrate>,<databits>,<stopbits>,<parity>,<flow control>

Getting on the Network
----------------------

Now to do as Victor did and connect to a WIFI access point.

First let's check that the system is in STA mode

AT+CWMODE=?  will give 1,2 or 3 (where STA=1, AP=2, Both=3)

Mode 1 or 3 is fine but, more config is needed in 2!

AT+CWLAP - to List Access Points...

AT+CWJAP="wifinetwork","password" - To Join Access Point

Note that the module will retain the wifi connection and you can just do an 
AT+RST which will reset the module and give a CONNECTED and GOT IP.

AT+CIFSR will give the current IP address on the network.

Next you need to connect to something
-------------------------------------

AT+CIPSTART="TCP","www.google.com",80 is the example in the video

That is just the first stage and means there is now a pipe from the ESP to the Google server

Before it does anything you need to send it something 

If you do feel brave before you close the connection then you can send

AT+CIPSEND=7

at the ">" prompt type:

"GET /" followed by 13 CR and 10 linefeed

I.E. Just press return twice...

AT+CIPSEND=length allows you to get the > prompt and type 'length' characters.

Incoming replies will be "+IPD,length:" followed by the data.

Finally you will need to close down the connection:

AT+CIPCLOSE

That all looked to hard
-----------------------

This is very fiddly so UART includes a mode called CIPSEND that does all the decoding for you

If you press INV VIDEO (SHIFT+4) then system will send an ATE0 to stop the ESP echoing everything
and then anything you type will be sent followed by a Return and Newline.

Anything the other end replies with will just appear. Note that at 14MHz you will get
more text before the system begins to lose data due to the delays in printing what is
received.

This mode is good enough to be a simple text terminal for a shell on a linux box or any test system.

If you connect to Google again and send four lines EXACTLY like this:

GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: www.google.com\r\n
Connection: close\r\n
\r\n

(where the \r\n represent what CIPSEND will do when you press ENTER)

Your screen will fill with the RAW data that makes up the very simple
Google home page...

So that's a bust then, the World Wide Web is just too advanced for the poor old speccy.
(maybe the PI accelerator will be able to help in the future...)

In order to get back to talking to the ESP you will now need to exit CIPSEND mode
by pressing INV VIDEO (SHIFT+4) again.


Let's try something different:

AT+CIPSTART="TCP","dict.org",2628

Should get you:

220 ..............some WELCOME.....

Go into CIPSEND mode with INV. VIDEO (SHIFT+4) and type:

DEFINE wn server\r\n

And you should get:

150 1 definitions retrieved
151 "server" wn "WordNet (r) 2.0"
server
     n 1: a person whose occupation is to serve at table (as in a
          restaurant) [syn: {waiter}]
     2: (court games) the player who serves to start a point
     3: (computer science) a computer that provides client stations
        with access to files and printers as shared resources to a
        computer network [syn: {host}]
     4: utensil used in serving food or drink
.
250 ok [d/m/c = 1/0/18; 0.000r 0.000u 0.000s]

Now send:

QUIT

and you will get

221 bye [d/m/c = 0/0/0; 16.000r 0.000u 0.000s]


I want the module to forget my WiFi network and password
--------------------------------------------------------

AT+CWQAP

Will close it all down if you do not want it to remember for next time.


So what else can you do at the moment with such a limited system?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Truthfully not a lot yet - experimenting with connecting to text only services
is about it, as most modern systems use very complex sequences now that are hard
to type.

Until a few years ago you could have sent an e-mail but, due to spam most
servers need complex logins now!  Your ISP may allow simple SMTP but, it is 
unlikely...


This is nearly enough to get on an old BBS system
-------------------------------------------------

Info about the sinclair retro BBS which has a limited number of connections
(10 I believe) run by Simone from Sinclair Software Preservation can be found at:

http://telnetbbsguide.com/bbs/sinclair-retro-bbs/

The CIPSTART connect you actually need to use it on a Next is: 

AT+CIPSTART="TCP","retrobbs.sinclair.homepc.it",23

Port 23 is Telnet for those in the know.

You can make a connection to this and it will stop with a prompt asking
you for a graphics mode buried among the control codes - and then kick you off when
you answer ASCII.

A priority is to make the ANSI support good enough for us to login to this server
 - watch the forum and fb for updates.

There are others around as well like http://www.mono.org/ many are
listed on the telnetbbsguide.

I need an ANSI terminal to connect to a BBS
-------------------------------------------

This is partially implemented but, diasabled in the current UART as it has errors - it
is possible that it will not be fully developed and it is more likely that the ANSI system
from Z88DK is used with the soon to be developed full networking support to create a terminal.

http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape-sequences.php

Min support for:

ESC[2J		- Erase display cursor to 0,0 (top left)
ESC[line;colH   - Move print position to line,col

Spectrum should be easy to do some of:

Esc[Value;...;Valuem 	Set Graphics Mode:
Calls the graphics functions specified by the following values. These specified functions
remain active until the next occurrence of this escape sequence. Graphics mode changes the
colors and attributes of text (such as bold and underline) displayed on the screen.

Making sure you have the latest firmware on the ESP:
----------------------------------------------------

Programming these using the Serial programmer is slightly complex and covered in the above
links - but, there is a built in function to do it once you have a WiFi connection. Use
at your risk the Author has done it once on a module and it did work but, you need patience
as the +CIPUPDATE:1-4 messages can take several minutes - DO NOT TURN OFF DURING THIS.

Updating the ESP8266 over the air

# Update steps

Modern security means I cannot get a shell on a unix box using netcat -b
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fifo's are your friend the whole world is your enemy so make sure you do
not expose your system...

rm -f /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f
cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc -l -p 10000 > /tmp/f

Notes from AA on timings to empty the buffer
--------------------------------------------

Once per frame should be enough

Are you waiting too long to check if data is available?  At 115200, it's a max of 11.5k/s sent from the esp.
At 3.5MHz, that's about 300 cycles per byte sent.  I think you can get away with checking for data once per
frame and draining the Rx buffer.

The ESP-01 does have two gpio pins exposed so if the esp firmware is rewritten you could use those for hw flow control.
I don't know if the default firmware is able to do sw flow control but probably not (it can't)

Changes from TBU .29 onwards
----------------------------

An improvement in the BAUD rate setting has been made in the core to allow any prescaler value you want - this means you
now have to calculate adjustments yourself for master clock timing differences when users select modes 0-7 VGA/HDMI

The advantage is that you can have a wider range of rates upto 2Mb! However, we have only been able to verify upto 921600..
Also if the core timing changes for any reason it is only a simple update to the lookup table below.

To set BAUD prescaler first write must be 0-127 which are the lowest 7 bits (the 0 in BIT 7 resets the value loader).  Second byte must
be 1mmmmmml where l is the 8th bit of the prescaler and mmmmmm is the top six bits of the prescaler value (1 just stops the reset)

The previously undocumented Next register 0x11 (17) can be used to read the selected display timing parameter.
I.e. OUT 9275,17 followed by IN 9531 (OUT 0x243B,0x11 IN 0x253B)
Victor used it to change the PLL
when X"11" => -- 17
		register_data_s 	<= "00000" & machine_video_timing;
This is needed to adjust the prescale value used to reflect the display timing the user has selected or the highr speeds will
never work.  Some of the lower ones will.

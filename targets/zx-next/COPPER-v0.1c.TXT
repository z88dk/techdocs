 1 Introduction

 The ZX Spectrum Next includes a co-processor named "COPPER". It functions in
 a similar way to the Copper found in the Commodore Amiga Agnus custom chip.

 It's role is to free the Z80 of tasks that require the writing of hardware
 registers at precise pixel co-ordinates.

 This guide provides technical information about the COPPER and display
 timing across the various machines and video modes of the ZX Spectrum Next.





 2 Overview

 The ZX Spectrum Next COPPER has three instructions: NOOP, MOVE, WAIT.

 NOOP is used to fine tune timing. MOVE writes data to a specific range of 
 hardware registers. WAIT waits for a pixel position on the video display.


 These instructions are stored in 2K (2048 BYTES) of dedicated write-only
 program RAM also known as a "Copper list".

 Each instruction is 16 bits (WORD) in size allowing for a maximum of 1024
 instructions to be stored in the program RAM. The COPPER uses an internal
 10 bit program counter (PC) which wraps to zero at the end of the list. The
 PC can be reset to zero, this is the default value after a hard/soft reset.


 The instructions are stored in big endian format and transferred to the 2K
 program RAM using the Z80 or DMA (bits 15..8 followed by bits 7..0).

 Three write-only hardware registers control access to the program RAM as
 well as the operating modes.


 System performance is not affected when the COPPER is executing instructions.

 The hardware registers and COPPER program RAM are not connected to the main
 memory BUS. The overall design of this system together with the use of
 alternate clock edges means that contention between the COPPER, Z80 and DMA
 has been eliminated.


 The COPPER has a base clock speed of 13.5Mhz for HDMI and 14Mhz for VGA.

 The bandwidth is around 14 million single cycle NOOP/WAIT instructions and
 7 million two cycle MOVE instructions per second.





 3 Timing

 To fully understand the COPPER, you must first understand the display timing
 for each of the machines and video modes found in the ZX Spectrum Next.

 There are several display timing configurations due to the four machine
 types, two refresh rates, two video systems (VGA/HDMI) and Timex HIRES mode.

 Details of these timings are outlined in this guide.



 3.1 Machines

 The ZX Spectrum Next has four machine types. The machine timing and HDMI
 determine the number of T-states per line which determines the base dot
 clock frequency and Z80/DMA clock speed.

 This guide groups machine types by their timing for convenience. The HDMI
 video mode overrides the default machine timing so it is included as an
 extra machine type which does not exist in the official documentation.

 Here are the four types used in this guide: 48K, 128K, PENTAGON, HDMI.



 3.2 Display

 The ZX Spectrum Next doesn't have video modes based on resolution that you
 would expect to find on graphics card based hardware. There is one fixed
 resolution of 256x192 which can be doubled to 512x192 in Timex HIRES mode.
 What it does have is the ability to set the refresh rate from 50Hz to 60Hz
 and horizontal dot clock. This in turn together with the VGA and HDMI timing
 affects the vertical line count giving several combinations in total.

 VGA modes 0..6 are included as one single VGA mode as the internal machine
 timing is constant across those seven refresh rate steps.

 More details can be found in section 6.2 Video modes.



 3.3 Resolution

 There are two main horizontal resolutions: standard 256x192 and Timex HIRES
 512x192. Details of LORES 128x96 are not included to simplify this guide.
 
 The frame buffer height is fixed at 192 pixels and surrounded by a large
 border and overscan as well as horizontal and vertical blanking periods.

 There are five vertical line counts: 261, 262, 311, 312, 320. Several pixels
 are hidden in the overscan and blanking periods beyond the visible border.

 The result is 256x192 and 512x192 pixel resolutions with a large border.

 The color of the visible border beyond the frame buffer can be manipulated.
 Visual changes will not show during the overscan and blanking periods.



 3.4 Dot clock

 The dot clock on the ZX Spectrum Next runs at 13.5Mhz for HDMI and around
 14Mhz for VGA. The COPPER clock runs at the same frequency as the dot clock.


 The number of dot clocks per line is calculated by multiplying the number of
 3.5Mhz Z80 T-states per line by four. Example: 228Ts * 4 = 912 dot clocks.

 The number of dot clocks per second is calculated by the following:

            T-states per line * 4 * line count * refresh rate


 In standard 256x192 resolution the duration of one pixel is two dot clocks.
 In Timex HIRES 512x192 resolution the duration of one pixel is one dot clock.

 Details of the dot clock counts can be found in the following two tables:


 Table 3.1: Vertical line counts and dot clock combinations

           48K VGA 50Hz   312 lines   224.0 * 4 = 896 dot clocks
          128K VGA 50Hz   311 lines   228.0 * 4 = 912 dot clocks
      PENTAGON VGA 50Hz   320 lines   224.0 * 4 = 896 dot clocks

           48K VGA 60Hz   262 lines   224.0 * 4 = 896 dot clocks
          128K VGA 60Hz   261 lines   228.0 * 4 = 912 dot clocks

              HDMI 50Hz   312 lines   216.0 * 4 = 864 dot clocks
              HDMI 60Hz   262 lines   214.5 * 4 = 858 dot clocks



 Table 3.2: Dot clocks per second

           48K VGA 50Hz   312 lines   13,977,600 clocks   14.0Mhz (28Mhz)
          128K VGA 50Hz   311 lines   14,181,600 clocks   14.2Mhz (28Mhz)
      PENTAGON VGA 50Hz   320 lines   14,336,000 clocks   14.3Mhz (28Mhz)

           48K VGA 60Hz   262 lines   14,085,120 clocks   14.1Mhz (28Mhz)
          128K VGA 60Hz   261 lines   14,281,920 clocks   14.3Mhz (28Mhz)

              HDMI 50Hz   312 lines   13,478,400 clocks   13.5Mhz (27Mhz)
              HDMI 60Hz   262 lines   13,487,760 clocks   13.5Mhz (27Mhz)



 3.5 Co-ordinates

 The top left pixel of the frame buffer is line 0 and horizontal dot clock 0.
 The is also known as "0,0".

 The bottom right pixel of the frame buffer in standard 256x192 resolution is
 line 191 and horizontal dot clocks 510+511.

 The bottom right pixel of the frame buffer in Timex HIRES 512x192 resolution
 is line 191 and horizontal dot clock 511.


 The line one pixel above the frame buffer is the last line of the video
 frame and equal to the total line count minus one (312-1 for example).

 The line one pixel below the frame buffer is line 192.


 The COPPER horizontal dot clock compare is locked to every eight pixels in
 standard 256x192 resolution and every sixteen pixels in Timex HIRES 512x192
 resolution. The NOOP instruction can be used to fine tune timing in single
 dot clock steps.



 3.6 Compare

 The COPPER uses a 9 bit vertical line compare allowing it to handle the
 various line counts.

 The COPPER horizontal compare is 6 bits meaning that it can wait for 64
 positions across each line. The range of this value is limited by the
 machine timing as that determines the number of dot clocks per line.

 The following table provides these values:


 Table 3.3: Maximum horizontal COPPER compare

                HDMI = 52
            PENTAGON = 54
                 48K = 54
                128K = 55



 Each horizontal compare is in steps of 16 dot clocks to cover the full range
 across a raster line.


 Table 3.4: Number of pixels between each horizontal compare

          16 dot clocks =  8 pixels in standard 256x192 resolution
          16 dot clocks = 16 pixels in Timex HIRES 512x192 resolution



 There is some slack to consider after the maximum horizontal compare value.
 The slack is calculated using the following:

          dot clocks per line - maximum horizontal compare * 16



 Table 3.5: Slack dot clocks after maximum line compare

       858 dot clocks per line   (52 * 16 = 832)   SLACK = 26 dot clocks
       864 dot clocks per line   (52 * 16 = 832)   SLACK = 32 dot clocks
       896 dot clocks per line   (54 * 16 = 864)   SLACK = 32 dot clocks
       912 dot clocks per line   (55 * 16 = 880)   SLACK = 32 dot clocks

 border, blanking and COPPER dot clock/pixel position compare values:

 Note: The HDMI overscan and blanking period is larger than that of a VGA
       monitor which can auto-adjust alignment. The following data is based
       on visible results from various monitors thus subject to refinement.

       Pixels are visible during DISPLAY/BORDER and hidden during BLANKING.



 3.7 Overscan

 The visible area of the display can extend to resolutions exceeding 256x192.

 The 50/60 Hz refresh rate mode dictates the vertical limit.

 VGA and HDMI differ with VGA providing more visible pixels beyond the range
 of HDMI. The following two tables provide maximum and ideal extended pixel
 resolutions:


 Table 3.8: Maximum extended VGA resolutions

                  50Hz = 352x288 (standard 256 resolution)
                  60Hz = 352x240 (standard 256 resolution)



 Table 3.9: Ideal extended resolutions for both VGA and HDMI

                  50Hz = 336x288 (standard 256 resolution)
 
            TOP BORDER = 32 pixels (50Hz)
         BOTTOM BORDER = 32 pixels (50Hz)
           LEFT BORDER = 40 pixels (50Hz)
          RIGHT BORDER = 40 pixels (50Hz)

                  60Hz = 336x240 (standard 256 resolution)

            TOP BORDER = 24 pixels (60Hz)
         BOTTOM BORDER = 24 pixels (60Hz)
           LEFT BORDER = 40 pixels (60Hz)
          RIGHT BORDER = 40 pixels (60Hz)

 4 Instructions

 This section describes the behaviour of the COPPER instructions as well as
 the bit definitions and execution time.

 The three 16 bit COPPER instructions are comprised of the following bit
 definitions:


 Table 4.1: Instruction bit definition

            NAME   15     8 7      0           CLOCKS
            -----------------------------------------
            NOOP   00000000 00000000             1
            MOVE   0RRRRRRR DDDDDDDD             2
            WAIT   1HHHHHHV VVVVVVVV             1

               H   6 bit horizontal dot clock compare
               V   9 bit vertical line compare
               R   7 bit Next register 0x00..0x7F
               D   8 bit data



 4.1 NOOP

 NOOP (no-operation) executes in one dot clock. It is useful for fine tuning
 timing, initialising COPPER RAM and 'NOP' out COPPER program instructions.

 It can be used to align color and display changes to half pixel positions in
 standard 256x192 resolution. Its duration is equal to one Timex HIRES pixel.

 This guide uses the name 'NOOP' to avoid confusion with the Z80 opcode NOP.



 4.2 MOVE

 MOVE executes in two dot clocks. It moves 8 bits of data into any of the
 Next hardware registers in the range 0x00 (0) .. 0x7F (127).

 The WORD value 0x0000 is reserved for the NOOP instruction so no register
 access is carried out for that special case. Register 0x00 is read-only so
 not affected by the restriction of not being able to write zero to it.

 This instruction can perform 7 million register writes per second for VGA
 and 6.75 million register writes per second for HDMI.



 4.3 WAIT

 WAIT executes in one dot clock. It performs a compare with the current
 vertical line number and the current horizontal dot clock.

 WAIT will hold until the current raster line matches the 9 bit value
 stored in bits 8..0. When the line compare matches, WAIT will still hold if
 the current horizontal dot clock is less than the value in bits 14..9.
 
 This compare logic means that out of order vertical line compares will cause
 the COPPER to wait until the next video frame as the test is for an exact
 match of the line number. The COPPER will continue to the next instruction
 after an out of order horizontal pixel position compare as the test checks
 for the current dot clock being greater than or equal to the compare value.


 WAIT will stop the COPPER when a compare is made against an out of range
 vertical line or horizontal dot clock position as they will never occur.

 A standard way to terminate a COPPER program is to wait for line 511 and
 horizontal position 63. This encodes into the instruction WORD 0xFFFF. 


 The horizontal dot clock position compare includes an adjustment meaning
 that the compare completes three dot clocks early in standard 256x192
 resolution and two dot clocks early in Timex HIRES 512x192 resolution. In
 practice, a pixel position can be specified with clocks to spare to write a
 register value before the pixel is displayed. This saves software having to
 auto-adjust positions to arrive early. It also means that a wait for 0,0 can
 affect the first pixel of the frame buffer before it is displayed and set
 the scroll registers without visual artefacts.



 4.4 Example

 The following example provides a simple COPPER program to move data to a
 hardware register at two specific pixel positions. The BYTES for the program
 are listed in the left column:


            PAL8    equ    0x41           ; 8 bit palette hardware register

 0x80,0x00          WAIT   0,0            ; wait for pixel position 0,0 (H,V)
 0x00,0x00          NOOP                  ; fine tune timing by one dot clock
 0x41,0xE0          MOVE   PAL8,11100000b ; write RED to palette register

 0xC0,0xBF          WAIT   32,191         ; wait for pixel position 256,191
 0x00,0x00          NOOP                  ; fine tune timing by one dot clock
 0x41,0x00          MOVE   PAL8,00000000b ; write BLACK to palette register

 0xFF,0xFF          WAIT   63,511         ; wait for an out of range position





 5 Control

 The COPPER is controlled by the following three write-only registers:

                 0x60 (96)   Copper data
                 0x61 (97)   Copper control LO BYTE
                 0x62 (98)   Copper control HI BYTE


 The COPPER instructions are written one BYTE at a time to the program RAM
 using register 0x60 (Copper data).

 An index system is used to select the destination write address within the
 2K program RAM. Eleven bits are needed to represent the index. Registers
 0x61 and 0x62 hold this 11 bit index. 

 The index increments each time one BYTE is written to register 0x60.
 The index wraps to zero when the last BYTE of program RAM is written.

 The instruction data is normally written in big endian format although there
 is no rule stating that partial instruction BYTES cannot be written. It is
 safe to write to the COPPER program RAM while the COPPER is executing as
 long the instruction data written does not create a mall formed instruction
 which comprises of one half of the current executing instruction and one
 half the new instruction - this could result in unexpected behaviour.

 The Z80 and DMA can be used to write the instruction data.


 Writing to program RAM while the COPPER is running has no impact on system
 performance as the RAM is contention free. COPPER timing is not affected by
 the Z80 or DMA writing to the program RAM. Program RAM is write-only.

 The contents of the 2K program RAM are preserved during a hard/soft reset.


 Register 0x61 holds the lower 8 bits of the index. Register 0x62 holds the
 upper 3 bits of the index as well as two control bits which set the COPPER
 operating mode.


 Table 5.1: Register bit definitions

             REG   7      0   Description
            ----------------------------------------------------------
            0x60   DDDDDDDD   BYTE data to write to COPPER program RAM
            0x61   IIIIIIII   Program RAM index 7..0
            0x62   CC000III   Program RAM index 10..8 and control bits

               D    8 bit data
               I   11 bit index 
               C    2 bit control



 The COPPER has an internal 10 bit program counter (PC). Each instruction
 advances the program counter by one after completion. The program counter
 wraps to zero after the last instruction at location 1023. This causes the
 copper list to loop.

 The program counter defaults to zero during a hard/soft reset.


 The control bits require a change to update the operating mode. This feature
 preserves COPPER operation when setting the program RAM index address.


 The program counter is preserved when stopping the COPPER. Two of the four
 control settings reset the internal PC to zero.

 The following table describes the control bits:


 Table 5.2: Control mode definition

    Name   CC   Description
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    STOP   00 = STOP COPPER
   RESET   01 = RESET PC and start COPPER
   START   10 = START COPPER
   FRAME   11 = Reset PC and start COPPER, reset PC each video FRAME at 0,0


 * The control mode names used in this guide differ from the official names.

 Here is a detailed description of the control bits:



 5.1 STOP

 This is the default operating mode set during a hard/soft reset. The COPPER
 is idle in this state and will STOP if currently executing when entering
 this mode. It is safe to write to any location within the 2K program RAM
 when the COPPER is stopped.

 Entering STOP mode preserves the internal program counter so that the COPPER
 may continue when restarted.

 

 5.2 RESET

 The program counter is RESET to zero when entering this mode. The COPPER is
 started if idle otherwise entering this mode acts as a jump to location zero
 when the COPPER is running.



 5.3 START

 Entering this mode causes an idle COPPER to start executing instructions
 from the current program counter. Entering this mode while the COPPER is
 running has no effect other than to disable FRAME mode if active.



 5.4 FRAME

 The program counter is RESET to zero when entering this mode. The COPPER is
 started if idle otherwise entering this mode acts as a jump to location zero
 when the COPPER is running.

 Entering this state enables FRAME mode. The program counter will be reset to
 zero each frame at 0,0.





 6 Configuration

 Hardware registers provide timing and configuration data allowing software
 to build and configure COPPER programs that function correctly across the
 various video modes and machine types. It is not essential to detect the
 machine type but it should be noted that software should not assume that it
 is running on a specific machine as the COPPER hardware is available across
 all four machine types.

 Three registers can be read to determine the machine configuration for Ts
 per line, dot clocks, refresh rate, line count and maximum horizontal dot
 clock/pixel position compare.



 6.1 Refresh rate

 The refresh rate must be taken into account and can change real-time so
 should be monitored and auto-configured when the COPPER is active as the
 line count will change with the refresh rate. This could lead to the COPPER
 waiting for lines that never occur.


 Peripheral 1 setting register 0x05 (5)

    bit 2 = 50/60 Hz mode

        0 = 50Hz
        1 = 60Hz * PENTAGON 60Hz is not supported in VGA mode so always 50Hz



 6.2 Video modes

 The video mode can only be changed during the boot process so one initial
 read is required of this register during software start up phase.
 
 The machine timing is identical for the seven VGA modes although the physical
 refresh rate of the video output speeds up for each mode in turn by roughly
 1Hz. The internal timing of the machine remains constant and as close to the
 original hardware as possible. VGA is a perfect Amstrad ZX Spectrum 128K +3
 for example as far as timing is concerned across the seven VGA modes.

 The effect of this speed up means that mode 0 will execute in one second of
 time whereas mode 6 will execute in a shorter time period. Mode 0 is as close
 to 50/60 Hz as possible where mode 6 is closer to 60/70 Hz. That would mean
 that one second of machine time for mode 6 will execute in 0.83 seconds of
 human time when running 50 frames per second at 60Hz.


 The eighth mode (mode 7) is used for HDMI timing. Machine configuration is
 forced for this mode. Line counts, Ts and various other settings are set to
 meet the rigid HDMI timing specification. For mode 7, 50/60 Hz are rock
 solid but the original hardware timing loses Ts across all machines to meet
 HDMI display requirements.

 Software that was previously written for specific hardware with hard-coded
 software timing loops may fail. This is one of the risks of coding timing
 loops counting Ts. We saw evidence of this with the release of the 1985
 Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128K+ and the later Amstrad models as previous software
 written for the ZX Spectrum 48K/48K+ would fail when trying to display color
 attribute and border effects as the number of Ts per line was changed from
 224Ts (1982 original 48K) to 228Ts (128K models). The ZX Spectrum Next runs
 slower in HDMI mode. Demos may fail to display correctly and games may slow
 down although setting the Z80 to 7Mhz can solve the game slow down, demos
 should be run in VGA mode for maximum compatibility.

 Video timing also affects audio output as the sample rate can vary depending
 on the output timing method.

 The following undocumented register allows software to read the video timing
 mode:


 Video timing register 0x11 (17)

 bits 2-0 = Timing:

      000 = Mode 0 (VGA)
      001 = Mode 1 (VGA)
      010 = Mode 2 (VGA)
      011 = Mode 3 (VGA)
      100 = Mode 4 (VGA)
      101 = Mode 5 (VGA)
      110 = Mode 6 (VGA)
      111 = Mode 7 (HDMI) * Timing is forced to 216Ts 50Hz / 214.5Ts 60Hz



 6.3 Machine type

 The machine type register can be used to provide the number of Ts per line,
 line count, dot clock and maximum horizontal COPPER wait.
 
 The dot clock (DC) is the number of Ts per line * 4.

 The maximum horizontal COPPER wait (H) is in multiples of 16 clocks.

 Video mode 7 (HMDI) overrides the timing.

 The following list shows the various parameters that can be gained from
 reading the machine register combined with the refresh register and video
 mode bits:
